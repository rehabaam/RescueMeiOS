RescueMe iOS
===========

This application is still in the development stage. I will need to have backend supported for storing the requests and sending alerts to the concerned teams.

About this application
======================

This application is intended to help people who are in danger by sharing their location by pushing it to one secure server if data connection is available or by sending an SMS with their location to one short code.

The backend server will capture the request and alert the concerned teams about the name and the location of the requester.
